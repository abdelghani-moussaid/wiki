Docker is a set of [platform as a service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service) (PaaS) products that use OS-level virtualization [OS-level virtualization ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(operating_system)) to deliver software in packages called containers. Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels. Because all of the containers share the services of a single operating system kernel, they use fewer resources than  [virtual machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine).



##Adoption

* Objects: Docker objects are various entities used to assemble an application in Docker. The main classes of Docker objects are images, containers, and services.[43] 

* A Docker container is a standardized, encapsulated environment that runs applications.[46] A container is managed using the Docker API or CLI.[43] 

* A Docker image is a read-only template used to build containers. Images are used to store and ship applications.[43] 

* A Docker service allows containers to be scaled across multiple Docker daemons. The result is known as a swarm, a set of cooperating daemons that communicate through the Docker API.[43]
